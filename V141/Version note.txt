Wrote over V120 that turned negative numbers into zero to make V121. So you can not find v120.

V121 solves the some of the split order issues. 1) index west had to change to east in line 289 for "new_item_west". 
2) When there is no entery for an item in east inventory nothing was being done. so that was being addressed too.


V122: They wanted to set the output of west orders in a different folder. hence addresses and outputs are changed in both files(01 and 02).

V130: There is a problem with Cash on Dellivery orders (COD). They customer has to pay twice when the order is split. The COD tag is 
inbetween //"tag"//.

V131: 1) When COD tag from west items is removed, the consumption tax also has to be removed. 2) Split order flag writes the value 1 as 1.0, it needs to change to 1.
 
V132: 1)Some of the orders (those that are split between east and west DC but no individual item is split) have not their COD removed and split flag raised.
2) All output text are commented out.


V140: 1) All the previous measures for dealing with COD and split flages are removed. 2) Split flags and COD tags are dealt with at the end of the code.

V141: Tel phone Numbers starting with zero, have their zeroes removed.
